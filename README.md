  <b>Fennecxx' Hyper Engine is a games website with games, apps, and a proxy (coming soon), with school gaming in mind.</b>
</h3>

### To start Fennecxx Hyper Engine:

Make sure you have the prerequisites:

 - **nodejs**
 - **pnpm** (install by enabling the NodeJS' *codepack* (install by typing ```corepack enable``` in a terminal of choice) and installing pnpm by typing ```pnpm install``` in a terminal of choice)

After installing the requirements, clone this repo by typing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yosoyelarugula/fennecxx-hyper-engine
```

Once in the directory of the project, open a terminal then type:

```bash
pnpm i && pnpm start
```

'pnpm i' installs the packages to the project, and 'pnpm start' starts the project, creating a server for the project.

  <summary><h2> Autogenerated Next.js stuff. (recommend looking at.)</h2></summary>

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
